          <p><a href="./index.html">Jason Scholtz</a> was born in 1995 in Hendersonville, North Carolina and currently lives and works in Atlanta, Georgia where he is earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Savannah College of Art and Design.</p>
          <p>His practice is a critical investigation of the systems of production and
              interpretation of images. He uses objects, photography, and the form of the exhibition to think
              through the material we use every day and its histories. Balancing between political and poetic,
              the work is meant to subtly destabilize our perception by questioning the conventions of
              communication and aesthetics which influence how we see the world.</p>
          <p>Scholtz’s work has been included in several exhibitions in and around the southeast. His first solo show is scheduled for May 2019 at Whitespec in the Inman Park neighborhood of Atlanta.</p>
